# -Numerical-solution-of-generalized-Black-Scholes-model
Implementation of a numerical scheme that approximates the option prices for different option styles, governed by the generalized Blackâ€“Scholes equation in its degenerate form using the HODIE scheme in the spacial direction and the two-step backward differentiation formula in the temporal direction.
